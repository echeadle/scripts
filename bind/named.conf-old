# Setup the trusted
#Above the existing options block, create a new ACL block called "trusted".
#This is where we will define list of clients that we will allow recursive
#DNS queries from (i.e. your servers that are in the same datacenter as ns1).
#Using our example private IP addresses, we will add ns1, ns12, host1,
#and host2 to our list of trusted clients:

acl "trusted" {
        10.128.10.11;    # ns1 - can be set to localhost
        10.128.20.12;    # ns2
        10.128.100.101;  # host1
        10.128.200.102;  # host2
};

options {
        listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 10.0.0.0/24; };
#        listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
...
...
options {allow
...
        allow-transfer { 10.128.20.12; };  # disable zone transfers by default
...
        allow-query { trusted; };  # allows queries from "trusted" clients
...
